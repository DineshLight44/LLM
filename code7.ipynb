        "This notebook demonstrates various **prompt engineering techniques** to optimize Large Language Model (LLM) responses for different applications. We'll explore 5 key techniques using Microsoft's Phi-3 model:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Objectives:\n",
        "1. **Understand prompt engineering fundamentals** - How different prompting strategies affect model output\n",
        "2. **Implement role assignment** - Guide the model to adopt specific personas or expertise levels\n",
        "3. **Apply chain-of-thought prompting** - Break down complex reasoning into step-by-step processes\n",
        "4. **Use output constraints** - Control response format, length, and structure\n",
        "5. **Leverage few-shot learning** - Provide examples to guide model behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "### Techniques Covered:\n",
        "- **Role Assignment** - Making the AI adopt specific personas\n",
        "- **Chain-of-Thought** - Step-by-step reasoning\n",
        "- **Output Constraints** - Controlling response format\n",
        "- **Hypothetical Scenarios** - Context-based prompting\n",

        "\n",
        "Before we begin exploring prompt engineering techniques, we need to install the required dependencies:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Required Libraries:\n",
        "- **torch** - PyTorch deep learning framework for tensor operations\n",
        "- **transformers** - Hugging Face library for pre-trained language models\n",
        "- **accelerate** - Library for distributed training and inference optimization\n",
        "- **bitsandbytes** - Enables efficient 4-bit quantization to reduce memory usage\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why These Dependencies?\n",
        "1. **Memory Efficiency**: 4-bit quantization allows us to run large models on consumer hardware\n",
        "2. **Model Access**: Transformers library provides easy access to state-of-the-art models\n",
        "3. **Performance**: Accelerate optimizes inference speed and memory usage"
